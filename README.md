## Data Preprocessing and Analysis

In the `Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction` directory, you will find Jupyter notebooks as Indivisual_Notebook.ipynb detailing the data preprocessing steps and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The preprocessing steps include handling missing data, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric features. The EDA explores the relationships between features and the target variable.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is crucial for creating meaningful input features for machine learning models. The `Indivisual_Notebook.ipynb` contains Python scripts  related to feature engineering techniques applied to the dataset.

## Model Building

We have experimented with various regression models
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regression
* Random Forest Regression
* Gradient Boosting Regression
* LightGBM
  
These models were fine-tuned using techniques such as GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV. The details can be found in the model selection section of the Individual_Notebook.ipynb file.

## Model Evaluation

We evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning are documented in the notebooks.
